# Heart Stroke Prediction

This project focuses on predicting the risk of stroke in patients using machine learning models. We analyze various input parameters such as gender, age, medical history, and lifestyle factors to develop a reliable predictive model.

# Stroke Prediction

## Dataset Overview

The dataset comprises patient information critical for stroke prediction, including:
This data science project aims to predict the likelihood of a patient experiencing a stroke based on various input parameters such as gender, age, presence of diseases, and smoking status. The dataset provides relevant information about each patient, enabling the development of a predictive model.

1. **id**: Unique identifier for each patient
2. **gender**: Patient's gender - "Male", "Female", or "Other"
3. **age**: Patient's age
4. **hypertension**: 0 indicates no hypertension, 1 indicates presence of hypertension
5. **heart_disease**: 0 indicates no heart diseases, 1 indicates presence of heart disease
6. **ever_married**: "No" or "Yes" indicating marital status
7. **work_type**: Type of employment - "Children", "Govt_job", "Never_worked", "Private", "Self-employed"
8. **Residence_type**: "Rural" or "Urban" living
9. **avg_glucose_level**: Average blood glucose level
10. **bmi**: Body Mass Index
11. **smoking_status**: Smoking history - "Formerly smoked", "Never smoked", "Smokes", "Unknown"
12. **stroke**: 1 if the patient experienced a stroke, 0 otherwise

## Dataset Information

The dataset used in this project contains information necessary to predict the occurrence of a stroke. Each row in the dataset represents a patient, and the dataset includes the following attributes:

## Project Context

Stroke is a major global health concern, ranking as the second leading cause of death per the World Health Organization, accounting for approximately 11% of all deaths worldwide. The goal of this project is to harness machine learning to create a predictive model that can identify individuals at heightened risk of stroke. Early identification allows for timely interventions, potentially mitigating the incidence and severity of strokes.

1. id: Unique identifier
2. gender: "Male", "Female", or "Other"
3. age: Age of the patient
4. hypertension: 0 if the patient doesn't have hypertension, 1 if the patient has hypertension
5. heart_disease: 0 if the patient doesn't have any heart diseases, 1 if the patient has a heart disease
6. ever_married: "No" or "Yes"
7. work_type: "Children", "Govt_job", "Never_worked", "Private", or "Self-employed"
8. Residence_type: "Rural" or "Urban"
9. avg_glucose_level: Average glucose level in the blood
10. bmi: Body mass index
11. smoking_status: "Formerly smoked", "Never smoked", "Smokes", or "Unknown"
12. stroke: 1 if the patient had a stroke, 0 if not

Advanced data science techniques and algorithms will be employed to preprocess and analyze the dataset, improving the model's predictive accuracy.

## Context

According to the World Health Organization (WHO), stroke is the second leading cause of death worldwide, responsible for approximately 11% of total deaths. This project aims to leverage machine learning techniques to build a predictive model that can identify individuals at risk of stroke based on their demographic and health-related features. By detecting high-risk individuals early, appropriate preventive measures can be taken to reduce the incidence and impact of stroke.

To enhance the accuracy of the stroke prediction model, the dataset will be analyzed and processed using various data science methodologies and algorithms.
